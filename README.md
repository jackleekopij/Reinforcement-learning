# Reinforcement-learning
Exploration of basic concepts of reinforcement learning. 

**Contents:**
  *Dynamic programming* (environment transition states known)
    Prediction - policy evaluation.
    Control - policy evaluation & improvement.
  Model free i.e. dynamics learned from experience (*action-state value function* used in place of *state value function*, the latter requires true dynamics be known).
    *Model free prediction* 
      Value evaluation of a policy. 
    *Model free control* 
      Search for optimal policy - policy evaluation and improvement.
